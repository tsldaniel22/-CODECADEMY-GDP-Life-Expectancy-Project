# [CODECADEMY] Data Visualization Project - Life Expectancy and GDP
Hello! This project involves the application of various data visualization tools including numpy, seaborn (sns) and matplotlib to study the relationship between life expectancy (variable 1) and GDP(variable 2) in six countries. 

GOALS: Identify the relationship between life expectancy and GDP in six distinct countries
DATA: http://localhost:8888/edit/Downloads/Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-Starter/Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-Starter/all_data.csv  
ANALYSIS: Plotting of data visualization graphs such as scatterplots to deduce how the two distinct variables are correlated to one another (eg. positively/negatively related, closely/distantly related)
