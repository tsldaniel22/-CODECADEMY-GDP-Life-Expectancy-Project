Hi all! Welcome to my first data science portfolio project on Codecademy. 
This project explores how the life expectancies and GDP have changed across six distinct countries, as well as the relationship between the life expectancy and GDP in a country.

**There are six underlying questions anchored to the project's analysis** :
1) Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
2) Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
3) Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
4) What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
5) What is the distribution of life expectancy?
6) What is the distribution of GDP ?

The data provided on the life expectancies and GDP of the different countries were sourced from the World Health Organisation and World Bank respectively.
Thank you so much for taking the time to view my project!
